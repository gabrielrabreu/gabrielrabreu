### Hi there 👋

🚀 Passionate about technology since childhood, I began my journey in computing by assisting my mother, who worked in sales, always eager to help with computer-related issues.

📚 My interest in software development started early, during elementary school, where I began exploring the Python language and creating simple algorithms. This was the starting point for a journey of continuous learning and passion for the field.

🎓 I had the opportunity to attend a federal school, where I could deepen my knowledge in software development and solidify my passion for the field. I graduated in Information Systems, making the most of every learning opportunity.

💼 With five years of professional experience in the technology industry, I have acquired skills in various languages and technologies, including Python, .NET, Angular, and React. I am committed to staying updated with the latest industry trends and tools.

🤝 In addition to striving for technical excellence, I am an advocate for teamwork and collaboration. I believe in the power of supporting and empowering team members, creating a positive and productive work environment for everyone.
